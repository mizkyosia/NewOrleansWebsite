    <h2>All the tools you need to plan your travel in our wonderful city, all in one place</h2>
    <p>New Orleans is a city of mixed origins, both African and French. It is a wonderful and beautiful place, full of
        life in the day and vibrant at night, especially alongside Bourbon Street. It is world-renowned for its Creole
        food, its festivals and celebrations (like Mardi Gras), its French Quarter, and of course, its music. In this
        website, we listed everything you need to know to plan your travel, including hotels, restaurants & bars,

            <h2>The French Quarter</h2>
            <p>
                The French Quarter is quite possibly the backbone of New Orleans. It is the oldest part of the city, as
                well as the one that brings the most tourists. It was built by the first French settlers when they
                arrived in America. It has been now designated as a National Historic Landmark, and is home to dozens of
                restaurants, music clubs, bars, museums and other activities related to tourism.
                <br>
                <br>
                It's a lovely and beautiful place, perfect for a little walk during the day, when you can enjoy its
                French and Spanish architecture and its joyful colors. But this place isn't only active during the day !
                Nightlife is really important in New Orleans, especially in that quarter. Music clubs and bars are often
                open at night, and streets are always lit up. It is a vibrant town, where you'll always find something
                that picks your interest.

            <h2>Louis Armstrong</h2>
            <p>
                How could anyone think of New Orleans without Louis Armstrong in a corner of their mind ? This living
                legend has influenced jazz to the point that now, you nearly can't talk about one without mentioning the
                other.<br>
                Born in New Orleans the 4<sup>th</sup> of August 1901, Louis Armstrong was one of the greatest jazz
                musicians of all time. He grew up in a rough neighborhood, named the Battlefield. His childhood was
                extremely rough, as his mother was only 16 when he was born and his father abandoned his family, but he
                never lost his hope and his enthusiasm. At the age of six, he entered the Fisk School for boys, one of
                the rare schools tht accepted black children in the segregated system of New Orleans at the time. His
                family also worked for the Karnoffskys, a Lithuanian and Jewish family. These people treated Armstrong
                extremely well, and since he didn't have a father, they fed and nurtured him. Armstrong wrote in his
                memoir that this family was discriminated against too, because they were Jews. It was the Karnoffsky
                father, Morris, who gave an advance to Louis Armstrong to buy his first cornet. This period of his life
                greatly affected Armstrong, to the point where he wore a Star of David until the end of his life, in
                memory of this family who raised him.<br>
                <br>
                Armstrong's musical career started in 1918. He first played in brass bands, and on riverboats, like the
                S. S. Sidney (first picture below). In 1923, he made his first studio recordings, for Gennett Records.
                The quality of the performance was quite bad, because of the cramped studio, crude recording equipment
                and bad acoustics. Moreover, the band was not paid much. In 1924, Armstrong joined the Fletcher
                Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band at the time. During this period, he recorded with
                multiple great musicians, like Sydney Bechet, Alberta Hunter and Clarence Williams.<br>
                <br>
                The Great Depression of the 1930s hit hard a large portion of the American industry, especiall jazz.
                Armstrong moved to Los Angeles in 1930, to find new opportunities. He found one, the New Cotton Club, in
                which he played alongside Lionel Hampton. In 1931, he appeared in his first film, Ex-Flame, and visited
                New Orleans, where he met old friends.<br>
                <br>
                In the 1950s, Armstrong was already a widely beloved American and jazz musician, as well as a cultural
                ambassador. In 1964, he recorded his biggest-selling record, "Hello, Dolly !". This song went to #1,
                making him, at 62 years old, the oldest musician to ever acomplish that feat.<br>
                This man marked New Orleans so much, that a park was built to commemorate him in New Orleans, the
                <a href="./Tourism/#armstrong-park">Louis Armstrong Park</a>. If you want to learn more about this
                amazing jazz legend, or the history of Jazz in general, we suggest you to visit the

            <h2>Mardi Gras Carnival</h2>
            <p>
                The Mardi Gras Carnival occupies an important place in the culture of New Orleans. Mardi Gras is a
                european and christian fest that can be traced back to the medieval era. It is the last day before the
                fasting of the Lenten season, and was the day were you'd eat plenty of fatty foods, pastries and such,
                before doing the fasting, that lasted 40 days. Mardi Gras was celebrated in New Orleans from a long time
                ago, the first celebration being in 1837. In the slideshow below, the first picture was taken in 1885.<br>
                <br>
                Nowadays, Mardi Gras is a public festival that is celebrated every year, during multiple days. People
                disguise themselves with costumes for the carnival, in whatever way they want, and then go in the
                streets to take part in the festival. There are parades that take place in the Mardi Gras period, with
                decorated floats going through town to display their wonderful colours and decorations.<br>
                <br>
                This event is now so famous that it is nearly the synonym of New Orleans. Most tourists that come in
                the city want to see this festival, yet it is really difficult to attend to it, due to the short
                duration of it and the sheer number of tourists making reservations to this specific period of time,
                limiting the places even more. But don't worry ! If you want to see Mardi Gras costumes, floats or
                traditions outside of the Mardi Gras period, you can visit <a href="./Museums/#mardi-gras">Mardi Gras
                World</a>, where floats and costumes for the parades are not only kept but also made !
