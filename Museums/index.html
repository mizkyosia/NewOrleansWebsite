        History is a very important subject. By studying the past, we learn from our ancestors, and we know what mistakes
        we must avoid in order to preserve freedom and our society. This is even more important in coutries like the 
        United States, where segregation towards black people existed for a long time. However, there is not only bad things 
        in history, and those things have to be remembered too. That is why, in New Orleans, museums are extremely developped.
        with more than 60 museums in the city, there is no doubt you will find the one that'll poke your interest !

                    The NOMA (New Orleans Museum of Art) is the oldest museum in New Orleans. It was previously named as
                    the Delgado Museum of Art, as it was initally funded by Isaac Delgado, a local art collector and
                    philanthropist. The museum opened its doors in 1911, but Delgado couldn't attend the ceremony because
                    of health issues. It features no less than 40,000 objects, covering a total of 5,000 years of art
                    history. It contains a vast majority of European artworks, alongside some American ones. Some
                    famous artists exposed there are Monet, Renoir, Picasso, Rodin...

                    This museum is not a simple WWII museum. It has been designated by the U.S. Congress as the official
                    national WWII museum of the United States in 2004. It opened its doors in 2000, and was primarily
                    focused on the D-Day, with the amphibious invasion of Normandy. As the Higgins boats, that were
                    vital to these amphibious operations, were designed, built and tested in New Orleans, the museum was
                    naturally built in this same city. Multiple planes of WWII and a Higgins boat are in display in the
                    museum. Multiple pavillons were also built alongside the D-Day one, to cover all the history of
                    WWII.

                    African American culture is deeply rooted in New Orleans, since a long time ago. As such, it was only
                    natural that a museum dedicated to that specific style of art was built in the city. Showcasing the
                    art collection of Dr. Dwight McKenna, the George and Leah McKenna Museum of African American art was
                    built in 2007, and was named after Dr. Dwight's parents.

                    Mardi Gras is without a doubt the most known event that takes places in New Orleans. But it is not
                    an event specific to the city ! It is celebrated in many towns around the world. Here at Mardi
                    Gras World, you can visit the place where the floats for the Mardi Gras parade of New Orleans are
                    built. This is a giant warehouse, covering 300,000 square feet, where multiple floats are at
                    display. It was created in 1984 by Blaine Kern, as a tourist attraction to give visitors a
                    behind-the-scenes look at float building.

                    The Historic New Orleans Collection (often abreviated as THNOC) is an institution established in
                    1966 by  General and Mrs. L. Kemper Williams. They wanted to protect their collection of Louisiana
                    materials, while still leaving it available for exhibition for the public, as well as for research.
                    It consists of 35,000 library items, as well as no less than 150,000 photographs, prints, drawings,
                    paintings and other visual artifacts. It covers a wide part of the history of New Orleans, starting
                    from the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 to the life after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

                    What would be New Orleans without its jazz ? This music has been a part of the city for so long now,
                    it wouldn't be the same without it. That is why, the Jazz Museum was created, to commemorate the
                    music that is so deeply rooted in New Orleans. It opened in 1961, and changed ownership and location
                    multiple times, even closing out of bankruptcy once. It contains multiple artifacts of jazz, for
                    example Louis Armstrong's first cornet, or even the first jazz recording ever made, on a disc from
                    1917, as well as 12,000 photographs from the early days of jazz.

                    New Orleans' Historic Voodoo Museum is a museum dedicated to the African diaspora religion of voodoo.
                    It consists of two rooms containing voodoo gris-gris and other artifacts related to voodoo. It also
                    hosts walking tours to the grave of Marie Laveau, considered as one (if not the one) of the most
                    powerful voodoo priests in the entire world. The museum also has a voodoo priest on site, giving
                    readings. It is a small museum, yet one of the few museums in the world entirely dedicated to voodoo.
