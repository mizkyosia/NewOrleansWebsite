    <h2>
        This website was made only for an english homework, it is not affiliated with the administration of New Orleans
        in any way, shape or form
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now that this point has been made clearly, let's talk more in detail of the actual website.<br>
        <br>
        Hi ! I'm the creator of the website. If you are interested in a behind-the-scenes look at this website, the
        source code is available <a href="https://github.com/mizkyosia/NewOrleansWebsite">here, on my GitHub</a>. And
        yes, i made all of this with my own lil' hands :D<br>
        <br>
        It's all made in HTML (for the raw elements, text and image), in CSS (for the style, if you remove CSS you get
        a website with all the text and the images but nothing more, and it's really ugly. You can <a
        href="javascript:removeCSS()">try doing it on this website</a> if you want), and a bit of JavaScript for the
        responsive parts, like the dropdown menus. The code for this website is actually pretty clear (for once my code
        isn't a total mess, yippee), so if you want to take a look into it, I believe you won't have a hard time
        understanding the code. If you have some questions, you can still ask me on my GitHub.<br>
        <br>
        Hopefully few to none people will see this website, because I wanted to do a credit page for the images but it's
        not finished yet, so i hope nobody will complain about the images not being sourced, i'm working on it !<br>
        <br>
        I also hid some easter eggs in this website, maybe you'll find those. Some are funny, some are less, but don't
        worry, none of them are actually harmful to your computer or anything. And as i said, all the code is public,
        so if you want to check by yourself you actually can !<br>
        <br>
        Welp, this lil' site took longer to create than expected, so i hope you enjoyed it. I know the content is not
        well developped at all, and the style is atrocious in some ways, but i'm no artist and i have zero artistic
        mind, so style wasn't my primary motive :/<br>
        As for the content, i wish i could've done a bit better, but i already passed a far longer time than expected,
        and i need to stop somewhere at some point. So yeah, it's clearly not finished, but at least it gave me a chance
        to develop my skills in web developping, and creating a real website for once. And i'll probably get a good
        grade for my homework too (Mrs Verharne, if you're reading that). So in the end, the time i passed on this was
        worthy.<br>
        <br>
        Sorry for this big chunk of words ! I just had a few things to say, and here i am with all this wall of text.
        I don't even know if it'll be red by anyone, but at least I did it. If you're still reading this, well thank you
        firstly, and secondly while you're here, don't you wanna see some of my other projects ? They are all listed <a
        href="mizkyosia.github.io">here</a>. For the moment, there's only a chess game, with a <i>feeeeew</i> lil' bugs in
        2-player mode and a useless and non-working 1-player mode (my bot program just doesn't want to work, and i don't
        even know WHY), but i'll try to improve it in the near future (can go from 3 days to 1.5 year, have some 
        patience please).<br>
        <br>
        Well, since it's 1:42 am and that the urge to go to bed becomes louder and louder, i guess i'll publish this
        and sleep. Have a good day, morning, afternoon, night or any time you're in at the moment, and hopefully i'll
        see you in another of my projects !<br>
        <br>
